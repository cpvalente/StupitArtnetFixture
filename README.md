HEY!!! :wave::wave::wave:

This code is part of a small install and didnt go much further than that.

If you are looking for receiving Art-Net data you will probably have a better time using [StudidArtnet](https://github.com/cpvalente/stupidArtnet). 
It contains a server object that you can use and has been widely used and maintained over the years.
